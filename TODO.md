Things that I want to accomplish in this that I still have to work on, roughly
in order:

* VT100 escape code sequence processing (including colors)
* Scroll-back buffers
* Character output buffers w/ interval flushing
* Rework communication to meet new simplified message formats
* Clean up the code, document it
* Add a latency visualization (data can be sourced from ping messages in
  communication rework)
* Add a damn UI
* Terminal resizing
